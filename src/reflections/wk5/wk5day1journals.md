What is the purpose of a Query String?

A Query String allows you to pass information to and from a website. You do this by adding that information to the end of a URL.



What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

The format is ?key = value. The way you distinguish between one parameter to the next is by the & symbol. For exmaple ?a=1&b=2



When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

As of today I'm not entirely sure why it's helpful. I would assume that this tool would be helpful to maintain, remove, or add different Query Strings.
