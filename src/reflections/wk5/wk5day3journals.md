In simple terms what is a sub-document?

Sub-document is a document nested in another document.


When might you use a sub-document?

I would use it if I don't need a document to stand alone. For example in the template they had the characters and a sub-document for their moves. 


How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them?


You can add to a collection of sub-documents by passing an object. You can a single sub-document directly similar to a normal object.
