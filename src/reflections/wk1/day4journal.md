What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Typically wire-framing is used by the UX designers. The purpose of wire-framing is to create or develope ideas before the app or website is built. 

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There's low-fidelity which is valueable because it's the starting point of the project. Using only basic designs, boxes, and images. Then there's mid-fidelity which is the "most accurate representation of the layout." This is where components and and features begin to have character and how they're design will be laid out. 
Last is the high-fidelity and this is where all the details are filled in from accurate texts to percise images. This stage is normally the last phase of the wire-framing process. 

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I think they're worth the time just because personally I am a visual person. If i can see it then I have an easier time "recreating" something.
I think it's worth the engery because I believe it's worth the time to get all your ducks in a row. Knowing what the project is and how to go about it. 
I also think it's worth the little extra effort to go through this process. In this case I believe in the attitude of work smarter not harder just because if there was no prep on what the project is I think there'll be more questions, confusion, and clash of ideas hence making the job harder.
