 1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A Pseudo Class is a class that is used to define or highlight certain elements. For example if I click a link to a page, visit that page for a bit and click back to the main page that link will be a different color. Showing that I have already visted that page. 

 2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is where the browser decides which CSS value are the most relevent. I'm honestly not quite sure how to use it to my benefit.

 3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Well knowing that the !important is used to resolve conflict I would think if you used it too much down the line when cleaning up or updating your code you wouldn't be able to determine what's really important and what's not. So long story short it would make cleanup/debuggin more difficult.
