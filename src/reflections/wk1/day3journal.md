What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

One of the most beneifical tips I've heard is where tags are divided how to located the opening and closing tags with one another. Sometimes when I have a long div tag with other div tags within it I tend to get lost! That is until Darryl taught me that it's connect within a line on the side. Helped me a ton with finding what div tag is with what. 


Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Something I didn't think about that looks good design wise are box shadows! I think they give it an extra sense of demension. Also not every button needs a background color was interesting at first but it actually makes a lot of sense design wise in certain areas. Not every piece of content needs to be flashy 


How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

For one when I see a good design I think it's intuitive and simple to use. Like spacing, colors, and placement being the most important espcially since people don't want to go scrolling everywhere to find a particular link. Also it shows the difference between someone who put together a website with a 3rd party application compared to a professional.
