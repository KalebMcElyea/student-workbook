What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are is a class that represents a group of constants variables.

How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify an Enum by changing it's base type and member values. You can also make an enum set the value of an enum member.


How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

We have not used Enums in our lab projects yet but I would assume we'd use it like in the example of the article. Where we would define low, medium and hight to define our volume level.
