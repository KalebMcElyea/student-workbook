What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type: A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. In basic terms it means to delcares a variable and gives it a value. Example: i = 100

Reference type:  A reference type doesn't store its value directly. It stores the address where the value is being stored. 
Example string s = "Hello Kaleb"

Pointer type: Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.



What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, and ushort.
Some of the biggest differences I've seen is that you have to define what you're doing. Example string h = "hellow world. 


In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Value types stores it's value directly. It differs from reference in the way that the Reference will store the memory address instead of the variable value directly.
