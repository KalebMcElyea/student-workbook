What is a List in C#?

List is a generic type, so you can create list of any type.

What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

I'd probably use List.Add. Really thy only reason why I think I'd use this method most oftern is because I like the ability to add more content to my list. 

How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

I would use the List.Find method. Espcially since the List.Find method returns list with the item matching the specified predicate.
