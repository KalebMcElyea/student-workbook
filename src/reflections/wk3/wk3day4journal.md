What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

It solves the "real world problems" of Javascript. It also solves the perennial problem which is just keeping a bunch of elements synced with the same data.


What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The subscribe method: To add new events. 
The unsubscribe method: To remove events. 
And the broadcast method: To call all events.

Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

I'm honestly not sure how they work together...
