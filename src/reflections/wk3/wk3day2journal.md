What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

It's purpose is to limit bugs from shared mutable state. It also helps reduce tight coupling between componets and data structures. 

What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

It expands the attack surface for hackers. It also leaks implementation details!


How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

You can use factory functions and true closure based encaspulation. This is better because it doesn't rely on convention and relys on true encapsulation.
