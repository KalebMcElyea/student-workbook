What problem does using exports solve?

It makes code accessible to other parts of our code. Wether thats exporting modules individually, default values, or single export statement.


How does export differ from export default?

Export default only exports single object or variable from a module.  

What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Code can be split into smaller files, debuggin is easier, it helps you organize, it can be concatinized so it increases performance.
