What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

* Unit Testing - Unit testing allows you to test individual units of code. 

* Component Testing - This form of testing must be mounted to the DOM to show that they are working properly. 

* End-To-End - End to end tests all the layers of your application. I.E testing the application in the eyes of the user. Testing it "live"

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

For me I would be more comfortable with unit testing. Just because I want to know that my code is working before hand instead of going down the rabbit hole of "why isn't this working?" 

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

End-to-end! Because when I run into problems on my applications there have been times where I find out there's a multitued of problems within my front end and my backend. So I tend to struggle with problems like that because I tend to get in my head and think "where do I start?"
