What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It provides either several medium size projects or a couple of larger size projects. Either way you want to show off your skills in a language that you are fimilar/comfortable with. 

What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

I think it's the meaning you give a project. The what's and the why's to why you built the app the way you did. 

What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

I know for sure I want to add my capstone just because it shows off some of my skills but it also shows that I can work in a larger team. I also thought about doing Moon Miner just because in terms of design it's the one I'm most proud of. Otherwise I don't have any projects that I'm "proud of" to show off to any employer.
