Good service Cheap won't be fast - The good service pros is that you'll get a great product that goes into a great amount of detail. However, since it is an application system that dives into a great amount of details it can a long time for the product to come to completion.

Good service Fast won't be cheap - The fast service pro is that you'll get a good product in return within a small amount of time. The con is that you'll have to choose and sacrafice certain qualities of the app in order to obtain it x amount of time.
