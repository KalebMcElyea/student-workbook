What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

So far we've been using a ton of Vue, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap to build to bulk of our app. In terms of principles I don't feel like we've used a ton of principles and towards the end I think it kind of showed.

What went well so far?

So far the design is coming out great! All the pages are turning out well, the effects are coming along, and ideas are constantly flowing.

What would you do differently? Why?

I feel like we've planned most of our app well, however when it came to our chat function we got meshed with different things and made it far more complicated than it needed to be. Also naming conventions were pretty bad in certain areas so that could've been handled differently.
