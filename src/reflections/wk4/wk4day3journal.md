What is the purpose of Async/Await?

They reduce the boilerplate around promises. It also reduces the 'dont break the chain' limitation of chaining promises. 


What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

When you want to call a function with an await you must prepend it. Meaning that you add the await to the beginning. Then the calling code will stop until the promise is resolved or rejected.


What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

It's far more simple to read! It can also be chained very easily which also lends hand in hand with the simplicity of reading your code as well. Lastly it's also easy to debug your code!
