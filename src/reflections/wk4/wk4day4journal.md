What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

It stands for REoresentational State Transfer. It basically means when the RESTful API is called the server will transfer a representation of the state of the requested resource.



What does Stateless mean?

It means that the server doesn't remember anything about the user who used the API. It does not remember if the user sent a GET request for the same resource as before.


What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

THE URL patter used is the HTTP GET method. It will also require a URL that identify the user.
