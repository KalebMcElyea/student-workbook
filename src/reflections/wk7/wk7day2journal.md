Code documentation is when you take notes or explain what a function is and/or what it's doing. Some ways of documenting are adding a read me, how to guides, or documentation in the source.

What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

One way is when you come to the code/project on a later date you'll know what is doing what and how it works. It also helps your co-workers with the same thing so they're not stressing about what you did and why.


How important is Code documentation and why?

It's important so that everyone will be on the same page during the project. It's also important because if you have to update or continue the project on a later date you'll know exactly what you or your partners did.
