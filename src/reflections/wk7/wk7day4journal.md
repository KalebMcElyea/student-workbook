Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We really took into account where everything was placed and that the styling has a purpose. When we started this we felt that everything was jumbled and boxed in and it made the application confusing to look at. We also elminated any tags or routes that were not needed. 

What went well?

Everything went really well! We took our time with our styling and stuck to our timetable and we managed to get done earlier than we expected.

What would you do differently?

Honestly I wouldn't change anything... This was an awesome team all the way around.
