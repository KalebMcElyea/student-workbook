What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

It's every interaction your business has with it's customers! Some things to consider is a mobile version, apps, and online services. 


What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

One way is that you could have a customer for life if you keep their best interest or experience in mind. When you have an application that is simple to use but gives the user everything they're looking for (in your app that is) then it encourages them to come back!

Why is the User Experience important?

Because the way the user feels about an application or website is critical and I think when we try to step into the shoes of the user we can create a great exerience for the user. No one wants to go to a website that is plagued with ads every 5 seconds or have a confusing website. A user shouldn't have to dive deep in the website to find what they're looking for. When we have a user friendly application it encourages the user to come back.
