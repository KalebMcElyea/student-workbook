What are props?

(Props are how we pass variables and other pieces of information between different components.)

What are props used for?

(Props are kind of like objects in the sense that it's similar to a collection of information. Similar to the camera example in the reading you have the camera name and the camera image.) 

Where can props be used or accessed?

(You can use props within the double {{}} by accessing the collection of information. You use this within a template to access that information and "draw" that information on to the page!  )
