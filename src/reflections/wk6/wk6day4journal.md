What is a nested route?

It's for SPA that allows you to go place to place within a single page. 

When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

We used it during gregslist where we have different tabs taking use to different parts of the page. Without ever leaving the "main" website.

Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes we can. You can utalize it depending on what you're wanting to display on the site.
