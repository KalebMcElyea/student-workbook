What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
You can write css in the console to test out colors, margins, and padding. I would use this anytime I need to adjust or recolor something. Also also adding text in html and changing the font sizes for a similar. 


Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The element tag! It's helpful in several ways! 
 You can change CSS or HTML values within the console before adding it to your offical code just to see what is looks like instead of changing your code entirely. It can also show you excess padding or margins and show you rows and columns. 


Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

You can use the debugger in your code to find the problem within the console log. Another is break points and break points will pause your code on that line.
