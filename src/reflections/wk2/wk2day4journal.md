What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

First thing for me is the visualization aspect of writing down each step and what each function will do. I find it easier to maintain and keep track of what I'm doing when I write it down. 


How do you find answers when you are stuck?

The one I was surprised the most by was the Googling/research route. That when you're stuck for a long while that odds are someone else ran into a similar problem and they could have the solution to it. However, while Google is a great tool we shouldn't be over utalizing it and copying and pasting everything because that could cause more harm than good. 

From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

That it's okay to struggle! I found that I'm very hard on myself for not knowing the answers or how to solve an issue. What I've realized is that the struggle is okay but the progress is the most important thing to acheieve.
