What is Scope ?
Scope indicates where the variables are avaiable for use. There are also two different types of scopes, local and global.


What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is a mechanism where it will move the function or var to the top of the scope. This mechanism happens before the code is exectuted. 

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Const: If I needed a constantant reference to a value I think I'd use const

Let: I think I'd be using the let variable the most (1) because it's the preferred variable.(2) It seems like it's the most organized because if you delcared a variable in a block it can only be used in that block. 

Var: Although it seems that var is the most outdated out of the two I'd used it to delcare a variable outside of a function. I'd also use var if I needed to update or re-declare a variable within it's scope.
