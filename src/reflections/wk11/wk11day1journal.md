What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

I see it like in video games where Inheritance acts like an add on. We have our base but when we need to add an extension or classify something specific then we use Inheritance. For Example Tim used the exmaple of birds. All birds have wings but not all birds can fly. So we create an Ifly and an IDontFly Inheritance and utilitze it wherever a bird does or doesn't fly!

How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

The way it works is when you have a model made and you want a model to inherit values from another model you do an inheritance. This does inherit all members of the base class.

How does accessibility affect inheritance?

While it doesn't prevent inheritance it instead access modifiers affect what you can and cannot see in the subclass.
