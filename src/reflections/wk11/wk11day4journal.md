Honestly, it's crazy that we're approaching week 12! On one hand it feels like it took forever but on the other hand it feels like it went so fast! My only concern is Vue honestly... I'm not the most confident in that language espcially when it comes to modals but I'm super confident in C#. The way I'm planning my time is to get the back end done first and then work on the front end. Hoping to get all of the backend done by the end of the weekend and to purely focus on Vue when instructors around to help guide me the right direction.
